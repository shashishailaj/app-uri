## The app: URL scheme 
[The app: URL scheme](http://app-uri.sysapps.org) can be used by packaged applications to obtain resources that are inside a container. These resources can then be used with web platform features that accept URLs.

We would like to acknowledge support from the European Commission through funding for the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2013-2015) under grant agreement nÂ°611327 - [HTML5Apps](http://html5apps-project.eu).
